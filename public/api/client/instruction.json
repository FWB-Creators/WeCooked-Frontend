    "instructionDetail": "A comforting and flavorful dish featuring creamy, spiced dal (lentil curry) cooked with aromatic spices and rich ghee. Served over fluffy white rice, this Dal Fry Rice Bowl combines the warmth of traditional Indian flavors with a modern twist. Perfect for a hearty, satisfying meal that’s both nourishing and full of flavor. Garnished with fresh coriander and a drizzle of ghee for a truly authentic taste experience.",
    "instructionStep": "1. Prepare the Dal:\n- Rinse 1 cup of split pigeon peas (toor dal) under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch and improves the texture.\n- Add the rinsed dal to a pressure cooker with 3 cups of water and 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder. Cook for 3–4 whistles or until the dal becomes soft and mushy. (If you don’t have a pressure cooker, you can cook the dal in a pot over medium heat for 30–40 minutes until it’s tender. Add more water if necessary.)\n\n2. Cook the Spices:\n- In a large pan or wok, heat 2 tablespoons of ghee over medium heat. Once the ghee is hot, add 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds and 1/2 teaspoon of mustard seeds.\n- Let the seeds sizzle and pop for about 30 seconds, releasing their aromas.\n\n3. Sauté Vegetables:\n- Add 1 finely chopped medium onion to the pan and sauté until it turns translucent, about 5 minutes.\n- Add 3 cloves of minced garlic, 1 inch of grated ginger, and 2 chopped green chilies. (Adjust the number of chilies based on your spice preference.)\n- Continue to sauté for 3–4 minutes or until the mixture turns golden brown and fragrant.\n\n4. Add Tomatoes and Spices:\n- Add 2 diced tomatoes to the pan, along with 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder and salt to taste.\n- Stir well and cook the mixture for about 5–7 minutes, or until the tomatoes become soft and the ghee begins to separate from the mixture. This step enhances the depth of flavor in the curry.\n\n5. Combine the Dal and Simmer:\n- Pour the cooked dal from the pressure cooker into the pan with the tomato mixture. Stir everything together to combine.\n- Adjust the consistency by adding a bit of water if it’s too thick. Let it simmer on low heat for 5–10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.\n- Taste and adjust salt or spices as needed. For extra richness, you can add a teaspoon of ghee at this stage.\n\n6. Garnish and Serve:\n- Pour the dal fry over a bowl of steamed white rice, ensuring the dal is evenly spread.\n- Garnish with freshly chopped coriander leaves and, if desired, an additional drizzle of warm ghee on top for a rich, buttery flavor.",
